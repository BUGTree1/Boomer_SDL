# Boomer SDL

A simple zoom (inspired by [Boomer by tsoding](https://github.com/tsoding/boomer)) crossplatform application written in C++ SDL3 and QT6 that when run takes a screenshot and zooms to where the mouse is. (just close with Alt+F4 or whatever you set in your window manager to close a window)

## Dependencies

[SDL3](https://www.libsdl.org/)
[QT6](https://www.qt.io/)

## Quick Start

```console
$ make
$ ./bin/boomer
```
