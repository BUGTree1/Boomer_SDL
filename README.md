# Boomer SDL

A simple zoom crossplatform application written in C++ and SDL3 that when run takes a screenshot and zooms to where the mouse is. (just close with Alt+F4 or whatever you set in your window manager to close a window).
I recommend to bind starting Bommer as a hotkey in your window manager.
Inspired by [Boomer by tsoding](https://github.com/tsoding/boomer).

Currently only Windows, Linux X11 and Linux Wayland are supported (may work on BSD but its not tested).

## Dependencies

[SDL3](https://www.libsdl.org/)

## Quick Start

```console
$ make
$ ./bin/boomer
```
